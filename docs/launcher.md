# OpenAC launcher

The launcher groups accounts by username. Expand an account to see its servers.
Resize the window to fit your desktop; the account list scrolls independently
of the launch controls.

Choose **Character select** or a known character, then **Graphical** or
**Headless**. Headless sessions need a named character. Check server rows and
choose **Play selected** to start all eligible selections. Each row starts a
separate supervised session. A failed launch is reported without preventing
the other selected rows from starting. Already active accounts cannot start
again on the same server. **Cancel** stops pending starts; use the row's
**Stop** action to close an active session gracefully.

## Accounts and servers

The bottom editors run inside the launcher on Windows and Linux. Saves are
validated and atomic; invalid entries do not partially change your profiles.
Close active sessions before saving profile edits.

**Edit Servers** has two fields per row: **Server name** and **Address:port**.
For example, enter `Local` and `127.0.0.1:9000`, or `Example` and
`game.example.org:9000`. Include the port; for IPv6, use `[::1]:9000`.
Use **Add server** or **Remove** to change the list, then **Save**.

**Edit accounts** has separate **Username** and **Password** fields. Passwords
are masked and may be empty. Use **Add account** or **Remove** to change the
list. Enter values directly; no separators or quoting are needed.

Every user lists every configured server, including servers added later. Users
can be added before any servers and survive removing all servers. Passwords are
stored locally. Older conflicting passwords remain in Edit accounts until you
choose one password per username.

Removing a server removes its saved characters. Keep server names unchanged
to retain their character settings. If profiles change while an editor is open,
reopen the editor before saving.

Use a named character row's **…** action to choose which installed plugins
load for it (see **Plugins** below) and to edit one-command-per-line logon
commands. **Logon commands** in the bottom bar provides the complete
structured command list for bulk editing.

## Plugins

The **Plugins** tab lists what is installed and what is available to install
from the curated list. **Discover** shows plugins not yet installed, except
any the curated list blocks; **Install** downloads and unzips one, but never
runs it. **Installed** shows what is on disk, with a source badge (**Listed**
or **Unlisted** for a launcher-managed plugin, **Direct install** or
**Bundled** otherwise), **Update** for plugins the launcher itself installed,
and **Remove** for those plus a Direct install. Removing a plugin also
unticks it for every character that had it enabled, so reinstalling it always
starts from none. **Refresh list** reloads
both lists; the launcher also checks once at startup, without delaying the
window. **Add from URL** adds a plugin from a `https://github.com/owner/name`
repository not on the list. Right after a curated-list release publishes,
GitHub's "latest" link can keep serving the previous release for under a
minute; wait a moment and press **Refresh list** again.

Every row shows its compatibility with the installed client: compatible and
which version, graphical-only or headless-only when the plugin restricts
itself to one host, the incompatibility reason, or that no client is
installed yet.

Every install and update dialog shows a short notice: plugins are made by
third parties, not OpenAC, and installing one is the player's choice and
responsibility; an unlisted plugin adds that it is not on the curated list.
The plugin is downloaded and unzipped, never run automatically, and stays
disabled until the player chooses to enable it.

Installing never enables a plugin. Choose **None** to install without
enabling anything, **All characters**, or **Choose** to pick specific
characters; an update carries no such choice, since it can only affect a
plugin already enabled where it was chosen before. A character's own **…**
action opens a checklist of installed plugins compatible with its launch
mode; only checked plugins load, and a blank list loads nothing, bundled
plugins included. Existing profiles are not migrated: anyone who relied on a
plugin loading by default, MossTank included, must tick it once.

A blocked plugin (listed as unsafe by the curated list) shows a red
"Blocked: <reason>" badge, cannot be installed or updated to, and is filtered
out of every character's list at launch, with a status line saying so. A
blocked plugin not yet installed does not appear in Discover at all.

A plugin folder unzipped by hand into the plugins directory, with no matching
install record, is a **Direct install**. It is checked against every install
rule that does not need a GitHub release: no links or reparse points, regular
files only, safe paths, the size and count limits, the allowed file types, the
manifest, and the icon rules; Finder and Explorer metadata files
(`.DS_Store`, `._*`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`) are ignored rather than
refused. A folder that fails shows a red "Refused: <reason>" badge, is never
offered to a character, and is left out of every session's plugin list even
if a character had it enabled before it broke. A second copy of an already
installed id, in any plugin folder, is flagged "Duplicate" on every copy and
loaded by neither, because the client itself refuses to load a duplicated id.
Passing or refused, a Direct install can be removed like any other. This
checking is advisory, not a security boundary: anyone who can write the
plugins folder can change a plugin's files after it passes, and a
launcher-managed plugin is never re-checked once installed.

`--plugin-list-uri <https-uri>` overrides the curated list for testing, the
same way `--update-manifest-uri` overrides the update feed.

## Installation and updates

First setup opens when required. **Installation & updates** always provides
setup, file verification and a manual update check. Available updates appear
above the accounts; **Review update** opens the existing verified updater.
Close active sessions before installing. Long content preparation retains its
progress and cancellation controls. Content and client compatibility checks
continue to gate launching.

## Server status

The launcher checks each configured endpoint every 30 seconds and on demand.
A green dot means the game endpoint answered; a red dot means no response
within the timeout (offline or unreachable). Gray means not checked yet.
Status does not prevent launching. Player counts come from TreeStats, matched
by server name or an unambiguous hostname label such as coldeve in play.coldeve.ac. Missing
counts are shown as unavailable and failed refreshes mark cached counts stale.
These external population counts are separate from endpoint reachability.

Failed launches stay visible on their account/server row. Play refreshes when
the reconnect delay expires, even if no further session event arrives.
