# Plugin API: chat, lifecycle, spells, storage, clipboard, objects, confirmations, session and loot

Everything here lives in `AcDream.Plugin.Abstractions` and has a default
implementation, so a plugin written against an older build still compiles and
a host that cannot provide something returns an inert value rather than
throwing. `docs/plugin-ui-markup.md` covers the panel markup separately.

## The tick

```csharp
host.Events.Tick += elapsedSeconds => { /* elapsedSeconds is always 0.015 */ };
```

`Tick` runs at a fixed 15 ms -- about 66.7 times a second -- and every tick
carries exactly `0.015` seconds, on every client. It is not the client's
frame: a client with a window draws far faster than this and a client
without one takes its own turns, and neither rate reaches a plugin. Between
them the client holds the time it has taken and spends it a whole step at a
time, so over any stretch of real time a plugin gets the same number of
ticks with the same total elapsed time whichever client it is loaded into.

What a plugin may rely on:

- the elapsed value is always the step, so counting ticks and adding up
  elapsed time give the same answer;
- one feed can raise several ticks in a row when the client has fallen
  behind, so the wall clock can jump between two ticks even though the
  elapsed value does not;
- a stall longer than about 0.2 s is dropped rather than replayed: the
  client does not owe a plugin the ticks it missed while it was away. So
  elapsed time added up across ticks is a count of the steps a plugin was
  given, not a clock: every stall leaves it further behind the wall clock,
  and it never catches up. Time a thing by the wall clock -- when it should
  next happen, checked each tick -- rather than by adding up steps, or a
  macro drifts by whatever the session has stalled for since it started;
- the tick keeps running while there is no world -- at login, and while the
  character is between worlds going through a portal -- even though the
  world's own clock is standing still, so a plugin waiting for the world to
  come back keeps being asked;
- there is no guarantee of a tick per drawn frame, and never was one worth
  relying on. A plugin that wants to do something every frame cannot; it
  wants the fixed step instead.

Everything else here that says "on the same thread as `Tick`" means this
one.

## Chat

### Reading lines

`host.Automation.Chat` offers two ways to read the client's text.

```csharp
host.Automation.Chat.Received += message =>
{
    // message.Kind, message.LogTextType, message.CombatKind, message.Received
};
```

`Received` fires once for every line the client takes delivery of, in
arrival order, on the same thread that raises `IEvents.Tick`. Nothing is
dropped: a handler sees every line while it is subscribed.

`CaptureMessages(afterSequence)` is the older poll. It keeps the last 512
lines, so a plugin that polls less often than that loses the overflow. Use
`Received` for anything that must be complete, such as a log.

`PluginChatMessage` carries:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Sequence` | Host-local, monotonic. Pass the last one back to `CaptureMessages`. |
| `SenderObjectId`, `Sender`, `Text`, `ChannelName` | Who said what, and where. |
| `Kind` | `0` local speech, `1` ranged speech, `2` channel, `3` tell, `4` system, `5` popup, `6` emote, `7` soul emote, `8` combat, `100` status notice (see below). |
| `LogTextType` | The text class the client colours the line by. |
| `CombatKind` | `0` when the line is not a combat line, `1` ordinary outgoing, `2` incoming, `3` failure. |
| `Received` | When the client took delivery of the line. |
| `ChannelId` | The number of the channel a channel line (kind `2`) came on, `0` on every other line. The fixed channels have no name and are told apart by it: `0x800` fellowship, `0x1000` patron, `0x2000` vassal, `0x4000` follower, `0x1000000` co-vassals, `0x2000000` allegiance broadcast, `0x4000000` fellowship broadcast, `0x8`/`0x10`/`0x20` advocate. A named channel carries its room number and its name in `ChannelName`. |
| `DisplayText` | The whole line as the chat window prints it, channel sentence and verb included, with another player's name in the tell link `<Tell:IIDString:id:Name>Name<\Tell>`; no timestamp and no closing line break. Match against this rather than rebuilding the line from `Sender` and `Text`: the wording of each kind of line is the client's, and it stays the chat window's. |

### Dropping lines

```csharp
IDisposable filter = host.Automation.Chat.RegisterFilter(
    message => message.Text.Contains("Your spell burned"));
```

A filter is consulted *before* the line is shown. Returning true drops it
outright: it reaches neither the transcript, the chat windows,
`CaptureMessages`, `Received`, nor the chat log file.

- A filter is offered the line before the language filter runs, so its
  `Text` and `DisplayText` are the words as they arrived. Every reader
  (`Received`, `CaptureMessages`, the chat window) gets the line as printed:
  with the language filter on, both carry `****` in place of a banned word.
  Match a filter against the uncensored words.
- Filters run in registration order and stop at the first rejection.
- A filter that throws suppresses nothing; the host records the fault.
- Dispose the handle to remove one filter. The host removes every filter a
  plugin installed when that plugin unloads, so a plugin cannot leave the
  client permanently muted.
- A filter registered before login still applies to the next session.
- A dropped incoming tell never becomes the client's reply/retell target:
  the same append point that filters gate is where that target is recorded,
  so a suppressed tell leaves no trace to `/r` back to. Only a tell from
  another player becomes the reply target at all; a tell from a creature or
  an item is shown but leaves the target where it was.
- Filters are client-wide, not per-plugin. A line one plugin drops is
  invisible to the client and to every other plugin, including one polling
  `CaptureMessages`. Match narrowly — a filter written for one plugin's own
  noise can silently blind every other plugin and the transcript itself.
- Do not post a message from inside a filter callback. The filter runs
  during line delivery, and posting there re-enters the same delivery path.

Short status notices — the ones shown over the world rather than written
into the transcript, such as "You're too busy!" — pass through the same
filters with `Kind == PluginChatMessage.StatusTextKind` (100). Check the
kind if a filter should treat them differently from transcript lines.

### Hiding lines from the display

```csharp
IDisposable hide = host.Automation.Chat.RegisterDisplayFilter(
    message => message.Text.Contains("Your spell burned"));
```

A display filter is consulted the same way `RegisterFilter` is, and after
it: a line a suppression filter already dropped is never offered here.
Returning true keeps the line off the chat windows and the console only.

- A line it hides still reaches `Received` and `CaptureMessages` on both
  the graphical and the headless client, and the graphical client's `/log`
  file, so hiding a line from the display never blinds another plugin or a
  bot reading the log. It is one client-wide display, the same way a
  suppression filter is one client-wide drop.
- The filter sees the same uncensored words `RegisterFilter` does.
- Filters run in registration order, and one that throws hides nothing.
- Dispose the handle to remove one filter. The host removes every filter a
  plugin installed when that plugin unloads.
- A filter registered before login still applies to the next session.
- A hidden line never becomes the client's reply, retell, monarch-reply or
  patron-reply target: those are recorded from the same lines a chat
  window shows, so a line the player never saw names nobody to answer.
- Lines any plugin posts, and the player's own sent lines, are offered to
  display filters too, so match narrowly enough not to hide your own repost.
- Do not post a message from inside a display filter callback, for the same
  reason as `RegisterFilter`.
- On a windowless client the display is the console, so a hidden line is
  not printed there either.
- Status notices are offered too, and hiding one drops it, since the spew
  box is its only display.

### Writing lines

`PostSystemMessage(text)` is unchanged. `PostMessage(text, logTextType)`
writes in one of the client's own text classes, so a plugin's own output can
use the colour the class carries. `Submit(text)` still runs the full chat
pipeline, commands included.

### Intercepting what the player types

```csharp
IDisposable alias = host.Automation.Chat.RegisterInputInterceptor(typed =>
{
    if (typed.Contains("[loc]"))
        return PluginChatInputDecision.Rewrite(typed.Replace("[loc]", Here()));
    if (typed.StartsWith("!macro "))
    {
        RunMacro(typed[7..]);
        return PluginChatInputDecision.Suppress;
    }
    return PluginChatInputDecision.Pass;
});
```

An interceptor sees every line the player sends from the chat entry, on
either client, and every line a plugin sends through `Submit`. It is given
the line trimmed and otherwise as typed, and answers one of three things:

| Decision | Effect |
|---|---|
| `Pass` | Leave the line alone; the next interceptor, if any, sees it. |
| `Rewrite(text)` | Send `text` instead. It goes back through the pipeline from the start, so it may be a plugin verb, a tell, a channel line, or be intercepted again. A blank rewrite counts as `Suppress`. |
| `Suppress` | Drop the line. It is sent nowhere, no command runs for it, it is not written into the feed, and nothing is said to the player unless the plugin says it. |

Where it sits in the order is the part to rely on:

1. The client's own command catalogue, and its help, are consulted first. A
   line the client claims as one of its own commands never reaches an
   interceptor, so no plugin can shadow or rewrite a client command.
2. Interceptors, in registration order across every plugin. The first one
   that does not pass decides.
3. Plugin verbs, then the channel and tell dispatch.

So a rewrite can turn a plain alias into a plugin verb, or replace a marker
inside a tell before the tell is sent, but it can never change what
`/lifestone` does.

- Rewrites are bounded at `ChatCommandRouter.MaximumRewritePasses` (8)
  passes per line. Past that the last text is sent as it stands, so an
  interceptor that always produces something new cannot loop.
- An interceptor that throws is logged once and skipped for that line; the
  next interceptor sees the line and chat carries on.
- A plugin may have at most `IPluginChat.MaximumInputInterceptors` (16)
  installed at once; the next registration throws `InvalidOperationException`.
- Dispose the handle to remove one interceptor. The host removes every
  interceptor a plugin installed when that plugin unloads, so a plugin cannot
  leave a rewrite behind after it is gone.
- An interceptor registered before login still applies to the next session.
- Interceptors are client-wide: a line one plugin suppresses is gone for
  every other plugin and for the player. Match narrowly.
- A host with no chat pipeline returns a handle that revokes nothing and
  never calls the interceptor.

## Lifecycle

```csharp
host.Events.LoginComplete += () => { /* the local player is in the world */ };
host.Events.Logoff        += () => { /* the session is ending */ };
host.Events.LocalPlayerDied += deathMessage => { /* the server's message */ };
```

- `LoginComplete` fires once each time the local player enters the world.
  A reconnect does not reload plugins, so it fires again on the same
  instance — treat it as "there is a fresh world to work with", not as
  one-time setup.
- `Logoff` fires when the in-world session ends, before teardown, so a
  handler can still read gameplay state. It is raised outside the host's
  session operation: a handler may issue commands (stopping the session,
  for instance) and they run rather than being deferred. The exception is a
  session ended from inside another event handler: `Logoff` is then raised
  within that call, and a session command issued from it is deferred or
  refused.
- `LocalPlayerDied` carries the server's death message. It comes from the
  death notification itself, so a plugin does not have to match chat text.

`host.Automation.Character.ServerPopulation` reports the players the server
reported connected in its login-time world-name message, or `-1` before that
message has arrived. The server sends this once, at login: it is a snapshot,
not a live count, and it does not change again for the rest of the session
even as players come and go.

## Character

### How a stat was bought

Skills, attributes and the three pools each report how they got where they
are, which is what a cost table is indexed by:

```csharp
ICharacterInfo character = host.Automation.Character;

if (character.TryGetSkill(skillId, out PluginSkillInfo skill))
{
    uint boughtSoFar = skill.Ranks;          // rows already paid for
    ulong banked     = skill.ExperienceSpent; // experience already in it
}

foreach (PluginAttributeInfo attribute in character.Attributes)
{
    // attribute.Ranks, attribute.ExperienceSpent
}
```

`Vitals` is health, stamina and mana in that order, each carrying the same
pair plus what the pool is worth:

```csharp
foreach (PluginVitalInfo vital in character.Vitals)
{
    // vital.Current, vital.Maximum, vital.Base (no enchantments),
    // vital.Ranks, vital.ExperienceSpent
}

character.TryGetVital(1, out PluginVitalInfo stamina); // 0 health, 1 stamina, 2 mana
```

`TryGetVital` takes the pool's own kind, not a position in `Vitals`: `Vitals`
leaves out any pool the server has not stated yet, so it can be shorter than
three and the two numbers can differ. `PluginVitalInfo.Kind` is that same
kind, which is why it is safe to hold on to.

`Ranks` and `ExperienceSpent` read 0 until the server has stated the stat,
and `Vitals` is empty until then, so check `IsInWorld` first and treat a zero
as "not said yet" rather than "never raised".

### Spending on a stat

```csharp
PluginAdvancementResult result = character.RequestAdvancement(
    PluginAdvancementKind.Skill,
    skill.SkillId,
    costOfTheNextRank);

if (!result.Accepted)
    host.Log.Warn($"{result.Status}: {result.Notice}");
```

The stat id is the one the record you read it from carries:
`PluginAttributeInfo.StatId` for an attribute, `PluginVitalInfo.StatId` for a
pool, and `PluginSkillInfo.SkillId` for a skill. Attribute and pool ids are
not the same numbers as their `Kind`, which says which attribute or pool it
is rather than what a request calls it.

`PluginAdvancementKind.TrainSkill` spends skill credits rather than
experience, so its cost is a small number.

An experience cost is capped at `PluginAdvancement.MaxExperienceCost`, which
is the largest number the request's own field holds -- it is 32 bits wide.
Anything above it is refused rather than quietly cut down to fit, because
cutting it down would not fail: it would spend a smaller, perfectly legal
amount you never asked for. Banked experience in the billions is ordinary at
high level, so "spend everything I have banked" has to expect this answer and
split the spend.

The client checks the request before it sends it, and answers:

| `Status` | when |
|---|---|
| `Sent` | the request went to the server; its answer arrives later as an updated stat |
| `Unavailable` | the character is not in the world, or there is no session |
| `UnknownStat` | a stat id of zero, an attribute or pool number that does not exist, or a skill the client has not been told the character has |
| `InvalidCost` | a cost of zero, or one above `PluginAdvancement.MaxExperienceCost` (or `MaxSkillCredits` when training) |
| `Refused` | the client declined it; `Notice` says why |

`Sent` means the request left the client, not that the spend happened: the
server decides whether it is allowed, and says so by restating the skill,
attribute or pool. Watch the record you asked about rather than assuming.

### Character options

`host.Automation.CharacterOptions` reads and changes the character's own
on/off options -- the switches on the character options page, which the
server keeps with the character:

```csharp
ICharacterOptionsAutomation options = host.Automation.CharacterOptions;

if (options.TryGet("AllowGive", out bool acceptsGifts) && !acceptsGifts)
{
    PluginCharacterOptionResult result = options.Set("AllowGive", true);
    if (!result.Accepted)
        host.Log.Warn($"{result.Status}: {result.Notice}");
}
```

An option is named the way the page names it (`AllowGive`,
`FellowshipAutoAcceptRequests`, `MainPackPreferred`, `ShowCloak`,
`HearGeneralChat`, ...), compared without regard to case; `Names` lists every
one. A change takes the page's own route: the client's copy changes at once,
and the server is told straight away for the options it saves on its own and
with the client's next save of the whole set for the rest. Setting an option
to the value it already has is `Accepted` and sends nothing.

| `Status` | when |
|---|---|
| `Accepted` | the option now has the value asked for |
| `Unavailable` | the character is not in the world, or there is no session to take the change; the option is unchanged |
| `UnknownOption` | no option has that name |

The client declines no change to an option it names, so there is no
separate "rejected" answer.

### Vitae

`Character.VitaeMultiplier` is what the vitae penalty leaves of the
character's stats, as a fraction: `1` with no penalty, `0.95` after a death
that cost five percent. It is the product of every vitae effect the server
has placed on the character, the same factor the client's own stat
arithmetic applies. `Character.VitaePenaltyPercent` is the same thing as a
whole-number penalty: `0` for none, `5` for `0.95`, always between 0 and 100.
Both read "no penalty" before the server has sent the character's
enchantments.

### Titles

`Character.Titles` lists every title the character has earned, in the order
the server listed them and then in the order earned since, as
`PluginCharacterTitle(TitleId, Name)`: the server's number
for the title and its text as the game displays it. The text comes from the
installed data files, on either client, and is empty for a title the files
do not name. `Character.CurrentTitleId` is the title the character has chosen
to display, or `0` for none. The server sends the whole list when the
character enters the world and one more title each time one is earned; both
read empty and `0` before that.

## Spells

`host.Automation.Spells` gains the whole table, not just what the character
knows:

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<PluginSpellInfo> everySpell = host.Automation.Spells.All;

if (host.Automation.Spells.TryFindByName("Heal Self", partialMatch: true, out PluginSpellInfo spell))
{
    // ...
}
```

`All` is built on first use and cached. `TryFindByName` ignores case: an
exact match wins, and `partialMatch: true` falls back to the first name that
contains the text.

Besides what a caster needs, `PluginSpellInfo` carries five raw spell-table
fields: `CasterEffect` and `TargetEffect` (the effect-script numbers played on
the caster and on the target), `FormulaVersion` (with the character's name, it
decides this character's version of the component formula), `DisplayOrder`
(spellbook order, rising) and `ComponentLoss` (how readily a cast consumes
components). Decal-era tools call the last three a spell's generation, sort
key and speed. A host that does not fill them reports 0.

## Storage

`host.Storage.RootPath` is the absolute directory the plugin's keys are
written beneath, or `null` when the storage is not backed by files. It is
for telling a user where their data went — keys still go through
`ReadText` / `WriteText` / `List` / `Delete`.

`host.Storage.EnsureDirectory("profiles/character/")` creates that folder and
every missing parent beneath the storage root without writing a file, so a
plugin can lay its whole folder layout out at start-up and again per server
and character at login, and the user sees where things will go before
anything has been saved. A trailing slash is optional, the call is safe to
repeat, and a prefix that would escape the storage root is refused the same
way an escaping key is. A host with nowhere to write returns false.

## Status board

```csharp
// One plugin says what it is doing...
host.StatusBoard.Publish("state", "Combat");

// ...and any other plugin in the same client can read it.
if (host.StatusBoard.TryRead("some.other.plugin", "state", out string state))
    host.Log.Info($"the other plugin is in {state}");
```

`host.StatusBoard` is a set of named text lines the plugins in one client
share. A plugin publishes only under its own manifest id -- `Publish` takes
no id -- and reads any plugin's lines by that plugin's id (compared without
regard to case) and the line's name (compared exactly). It is how one plugin
can show or report another's state without the two referencing each other.
`Capture(pluginId)` copies every line one plugin has published.

`Publish(key, null)` clears a line. `Publish` returns false for a blank key
or one longer than 128 characters, a value longer than 4096 characters, and
a 257th line for one plugin. The board starts empty with each plugin session
(each time the client loads its plugins, not each login) and nothing on it
leaves the client; a plugin's lines are cleared when it is unloaded and it
can write none after that, so a line never outlives the plugin that wrote
it. Both clients
keep the board the same way.

## Clipboard

```csharp
if (!host.Clipboard.TrySetText(report))
    host.Log.Warn("Nothing was copied.");
```

The graphical client copies through the same device its own text controls
use. A host without a window has no clipboard and returns false, as does a
failed attempt, so always handle false rather than assuming the copy
happened.

`TrySetText` verifies the write by reading the clipboard back before
reporting success, so a silent platform failure (the graphical backend's
GLFW clipboard call can no-op without an exception) is reported as
`false` rather than a false `true`. That verification is only meaningful
on Windows: X11 and Wayland treat the clipboard as ownership-based, so as
long as this process still owns the selection, the getter just returns
its own last-set string back regardless of whether anything reached a
real system clipboard.

## Objects

```csharp
host.Events.ObjectChanged += change =>
{
    // change.ObjectId, change.Kind
};
host.Events.ContainerOpened += containerObjectId => { /* the corpse/chest/crate now open */ };
host.Events.ContainerClosed += containerObjectId => { /* it just closed */ };
```

`ObjectChanged` fires for every change to a world object the client is
tracking, on the same thread as `Tick`, in the host's own delivery order.
`PluginObjectChange.Kind` is one of:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Created` | The object entered the client's object table for the first time. |
| `Updated` | A non-positional property or other field changed. |
| `IdentReceived` | The client took delivery of appraisal data for the object: the first reveal AND a later refresh of data already held (durability, stack count, and similar can change between requests). |
| `Moved` | The object's position changed enough to move it into a different cell. An in-cell position update that does not cross a cell boundary reports as `Updated` instead. |
| `Released` | The object left the client's object table (deleted, withdrawn, or an owned item leaving inventory). |

A bulk container reset carries no single object id and is not reported.

A `Released` does not always mean the object is gone. When the server
re-describes something already in the world, the client retires the
incarnation it was holding and registers the fresh one under the same id, so
a plugin hears `Released` and then `Created` for that id in the same batch --
and, for an object the client also holds a row for, twice over, once from
each source (see the note on two calls per change below). The id is still
live afterwards. Treat a `Released` as final only if no `Created` for the
same id follows it before the next `Tick`; a plugin that drops its target on
the first `Released` loses the creature standing in front of it every time
the server repeats itself. Both clients report this identically.

### What is in the world: objects and scenery

`host.State` carries two lists, and they are two different kinds of thing.

```csharp
foreach (var entity in host.State.Entities) { /* live objects and creatures */ }
foreach (var piece in host.State.SceneryObjects) { /* trees, rocks, buildings */ }
```

`State.Entities` is what the world server has told this client about:
creatures, players, items on the ground, doors, everything a command can
name. Each entry's `Id` matches the object id every other part of this API
uses, so a guid out of `Entities` can be selected, used, attacked or
appraised. `Events.EntitySpawned` fires once for each entry as it appears,
and a handler attached late is replayed the entries already there before it
starts receiving new ones, so a plugin never has to poll to catch up. An
entry leaves the list when the object leaves the world -- deleted, or carried
into a pack -- and `ObjectChanged` reports that as `Released`.

`State.SceneryObjects` is the fixed decoration that comes with the map rather
than from the server. Nothing in it has a server identity: these ids are not
object ids, they never appear in `Entities`, and no command accepts one. Read
it to understand the shape of the surroundings, and for nothing else.

Both lists are snapshots the host rebuilds rather than collections mutated
under a reader.

Some of what an appraisal reveals is known before one. The body parts a
piece of armor or clothing covers come with the object when it first
appears, so `PluginWorldObject.CoverageMask` and
`PluginInventoryItem.CoverageMask` carry those coverage bits for an item
that has never been appraised; both are zero for anything that is not worn.

For a plugin that reproduces another tool's record of an object, both
records also carry `Header`, a `PluginObjectHeader` with the raw words the
server laid the object's latest full description out by -- the weenie
header flags, the second header word, the physics description flags, the
physics state and the object description bit field -- and the optional
values that description carried: the setup id, the scale, the hook type,
the parent it is attached to and where, and the use radius. Each is exactly
as sent and null when the description did not carry it, so a value the
server left out is told apart from one it sent as zero. `Header` itself is
null for an object the client never received a description of. An item's
`UseRadius` comes from its body while it is out in the world and from its
description while it sits in a pack.

`host.Automation.Objects.Identify(objectId)` requests an appraisal of any
object present in the object table -- owned inventory, equipped,
landscape, a vendor listing, or an open container's content -- through
the same appraisal request the client's own assess uses, gated the same
way (`Busy` while another inventory request is in flight; `InvalidItem`
only for a guid the client has never seen). This is a different, wider
rule than `host.Automation.Loot.Identify`, which is deliberately scoped
to the currently open corpse/container's contents for a loot-sorting
plugin. Both report their result through the same `IdentReceived`
`ObjectChanged` event once the appraisal response lands -- `Identify`
itself only reports whether the request was accepted (`Started`) or
refused, not the appraisal outcome.

For a portal, `Objects.TryGet` and `Objects.CaptureObjects` expose
`PortalDestination`, `PortalMinimumLevel`, and `PortalMaximumLevel` on the
`PluginWorldObject` snapshot. These fields are filled only by an appraisal.
Before appraisal, `null` means the value is unknown; after appraisal, `null`
can mean there is no destination or level limit. Check `HasAppraisalData` to
tell the two cases apart. The destination is server supplied display text and
should not be parsed as a cell id. `IdentReceived` signals when to read the
fields again.

`IdentReceived` is reported from the appraisal response path; every other
kind is reported from the entity and inventory delta observers, which are
separate sources delivered in the same `Tick`-thread order but not
interleaved by a single shared sequence. An item held in inventory can
therefore raise two `ObjectChanged` calls for one underlying change (one
from the entity side, one from the inventory side); do not assume exactly
one call per change for such objects.

A plugin-driven `Identify` never touches the client's own examination
window. The object's properties/profiles update and `IdentReceived` fires
exactly as above regardless of what the window is showing, but the window
itself only opens, retargets, or comes to the front for the user's own
assess action (the assess keybind/click, or a headless bot's equivalent
"examine selected" command). Two exceptions follow directly from that
rule, not around it:

- If the object a plugin just identified happens to be the one already
  open in the window, that window's displayed numbers refresh in place
  (the user is already looking at it, so a durability tick or stack-count
  change should show up) -- but the window is never reopened or brought
  to the front for it.
- If the user assesses something while a plugin's `Identify` is still
  awaiting its response, the user's request wins the window: it opens (or
  retargets) for the user's object once that response lands, exactly as
  if no plugin request had been in flight.

The reverse never happens the other way: a plugin's `Identify` never
displaces a user assess that is already awaiting its response. It is
refused outright (`Refused`, or `Busy` if caught by the ordinary
busy-request gate first) rather than silently stealing the single
appraisal slot and making the user's own assess produce nothing.

`host.Automation.Loot.Appraisal` (`PluginAppraisalState`) reports the
shared appraisal slot's `Revision`/`AwaitingObjectId`/`CurrentObjectId` so
a plugin can poll for its own `Identify` to finish without waiting on
`IdentReceived`. `CurrentObjectId` is a completion signal, not the
window's displayed object -- it advances to whatever object last finished
an appraisal, of either origin, precisely because a plugin's Identify
must complete even while the examination window is showing something
else entirely (or nothing). Compare it against the id you passed to
`Identify`, together with `AwaitingObjectId` no longer matching that same
id, to know the response has landed.

`CurrentObjectId` is only meaningful for the request you yourself most
recently accepted -- it is not a history of every object ever appraised.
Issuing a new `Identify` for the same object id you previously saw
complete clears the signal for that id immediately (before the new
request is even sent), and cancelling the slot for a spell examine clears
it unconditionally. Do not compare `CurrentObjectId` against an id from
an earlier, already-consumed `Identify` call -- only against the id you
passed to the `Identify` call whose completion you are currently waiting
on.

`ContainerOpened` / `ContainerClosed` track the client's one open external
container — a corpse, a chest, a housing storage crate. A vendor's shop pane
is a separate surface (not covered by this event) and does not raise it.
Replacing one open container with another before it closes still reports a
`ContainerClosed` for the one that was open.

### Using a world object you don't own

```csharp
PluginItemCommandResult result = host.Automation.Items.Use(vendorObjectId);
// result.Status is Started once the walk begins; the vendor/corpse/chest
// panel (or IEvents.ContainerOpened) follows once the player arrives.
```

`Items.Use(objectId)` works for two different kinds of target, and picks
the right path automatically:

- An **owned item** (inventory, equipped, wielded) goes through the same
  inventory-use path as before — no movement, an immediate `Started` or
  `Refused`.
- A **world object** the plugin doesn't own — a vendor, a corpse, a chest,
  an NPC — walks to it first if it's out of range, the same way a
  double-click on it does, and dispatches the actual use once the player
  arrives. `Started` here means the walk (or the immediate use, if already
  in range) began, not that a container is open yet; watch
  `IEvents.ContainerOpened` or the vendor automation's own `Opened` event
  for that. The walk, the use it sends on arrival and the give-up on a walk
  that never gets there are the same on a client with no window.

The world-object path is held to the same gates a click (or an owned
item's own automation) is held to, rather than bypassing them:

- `Refused` means the object isn't useable at all (for example, a target
  that requires being appraised first), or is another player — a
  player-to-player exchange goes through the Trade surface, not Use.
- `Busy` means the pacing between two uses had not lapsed, an inventory
  request was already in flight, or an approach/use was already pending —
  the pending one is left alone rather than cancelled. The first two are
  what `Items.IsBusy` reports; see "Busy means 'not yet'" below.
- `Unavailable` means the send itself was rejected by the transport,
  distinct from `Busy`'s "try again shortly".

`Apply(objectId, targetObjectId)` — using one item on another — is
unaffected by this: it still requires `objectId` to be an owned item.

`Items.MoveToContainer(item, container, amount, placement, joinStack: true)`
moves an item the way dropping a stack onto a pack does: it first looks for a
stack of the same thing in the container (its own items, then each pack inside
it) with room for everything being moved, and joins the first one it finds
with a merge, needing no free slot. A stack with room for only part of it is
passed over; with no stack to join, it is the ordinary move or split. The
four-argument `MoveToContainer` never joins.

Automation item commands (`Items.Use`/`Apply`/`MoveToContainer`/... and
this world-object path) are not thread-safe against each other or against
the client's own input: issue them from the same thread `IEvents.Tick`
fires on, exactly like every other automation entry point. A plugin that
calls them from its own background thread or an async continuation is
mutating movement/inventory/transport state the client's main thread also
touches, with no lock between the two.

### Weapon and armor profiles

```csharp
if (host.Automation.Objects.TryCaptureProperties(objectId, out PluginItemProperties properties))
{
    if (properties.WeaponProfile is { } weapon)
        Console.WriteLine($"Damage {weapon.Damage}, offense {weapon.WeaponOffense}");
    if (properties.ArmorProfile is { } armor)
        Console.WriteLine($"AL {armor.ArmorLevel}, slash {armor.SlashMod}");
}
```

An appraisal response carries two optional typed blobs alongside the
regular property tables: a weapon's real damage/offense numbers
(`PluginWeaponProfile`) and a piece of armor's per-damage-type protection
modifiers (`PluginArmorProfile`). Neither travels through
`PropertyInt`/`PropertyFloat` — the server does not populate those for
most weapons — so `TryCaptureProperties` (on `Objects`, the loot
surface's scoped `Identify`, and the item-automation surface) exposes them
as their own fields on `PluginItemProperties`:

- `WeaponProfile` is non-null only after the object has been successfully
  appraised AND its appraisal carried a WeaponProfile blob (i.e. it is a
  weapon). It stays null for a never-appraised object or a non-weapon.
- `ArmorProfile` is the armor equivalent, non-null only for an appraised
  piece of armor. `ArmorLevel` comes from the object's own
  `PropertyInt.ArmorLevel`, not the ArmorProfile blob itself, which does
  not carry it.
- A later, unrelated property update never clears an already-retained
  profile — only a fresh appraisal response does, and it fully replaces
  (or clears, if the new response omits the blob) whatever was there
  before.

`PluginInventoryItem`'s own `WeaponSkill`, `DamageType`, `Damage`, and
`DamageVariance` fields prefer the retained `WeaponProfile` when one is
present, falling back to the property table only for an unappraised item.
`Damage == -1` means the server's response left it unset (its own wire
sentinel is `uint.MaxValue`), not a real zero-or-negative damage value.

Units, since none of these read as plain integers or percentages:

- `WeaponOffense` and `DamageMod` are MULTIPLIERS centered on 1.0 — `1.05`
  means "+5%", `0.9` means "-10%", not an absolute offense/damage number.
- `DamageVariance` is a FRACTION of `Damage` describing the roll's floor:
  an actual hit rolls somewhere in
  `[(1 − DamageVariance) × Damage, Damage]`. `0.2` on a `Damage` of `12`
  means a real hit lands between `9.6` and `12`, never `0.2` itself.
- `WeaponTime` is a speed rating, not a duration in milliseconds or
  seconds — higher is slower, and it feeds the same attack-timing formula
  the assess window's own speed line uses.
- Every armor `*Mod` field (`SlashMod`, `PierceMod`, `BludgeonMod`,
  `ColdMod`, `FireMod`, `AcidMod`, `NetherMod`, `ElectricMod`) is also a
  MULTIPLIER applied to incoming damage of that type — `1.2` means that
  damage type does 20% MORE to the wearer, `0.8` means 20% less. It is not
  the flat armor-level number; `ArmorLevel` is the separate field for that.

### Crafting and tinkering values

`Items.CaptureOwnedItems()` returns a `PluginInventoryItem` per owned item,
and a crafting calculator needs a particular handful of its fields. Both
hosts project them from the same runtime object table, so a plugin reads
identical numbers windowed and headless.

| Field | Type | Where it comes from | When it is absent |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Workmanship` | `float` | the workmanship the server sends with the object: fractional, 1 to 10, not the whole-number band an appraisal shows. A bag of salvage carries the average workmanship of everything melted into it | `0` |
| `SalvageWorkmanship` | `double` | the same value as a `double`. Widening recovers nothing the server did not send; it is there for a calculator that works in doubles | `0` |
| `NumTimesTinkered` | `int` | the item's tinker count | `0` |
| `ImbuedEffect` | `int` | the imbue flags: the rends and the critical bonuses. Any non-zero value means the item cannot be imbued again | `0` |
| `MaterialType` | `uint` | what the item is made of | `0` |
| `ArmorLevel` | `int` | the item's flat armor value, from its own property table, so it is there without an appraisal | `0` |
| `MaxDamage` | `int` | the top of the damage roll: `Damage` with the server's "unset" sentinel folded to zero, so it is always usable in a sum | `0` |
| `WandElementalDamageType` | `int` | the damage type in the item's own property table, which is where a casting weapon's element lives | `0` |
| `Retained` | `bool` | the mark that stops an item being dropped, sold, or salvaged by accident | `false` |

Four more values a calculator asks for are already on the snapshot under
their own names, so there is no second copy of them:

- the equipable-slot mask is `ValidLocations`;
- the uses remaining is `Structure`, with its ceiling in
  `MaximumStructure`;
- the damage variance is `DamageVariance`;
- the damage rating itself is `Damage`. Unlike `MaxDamage` it keeps the
  server's `-1` for "never set", and unlike `WandElementalDamageType` its
  sibling `DamageType` prefers the appraised weapon profile.

`Objects.TryGet`/`CaptureObjects` are real on the headless host (see
[Headless](#headless)), but `Objects.TryCaptureProperties` and
`Objects.Identify` are not -- they need appraisal-wire and
external-container machinery no headless macro exercises yet, so they
always return `false`/`Unavailable` there regardless of whether the
object was ever appraised. The `Items`/`Loot` automation surfaces are
still entirely no-op on headless. `Vendor.TryCaptureProperties` is real on
both hosts -- the vendor automation adapter is shared verbatim between the
graphical and headless hosts, so a headless vendor-shopping plugin gets
the same `WeaponProfile`/`ArmorProfile` data a graphical one does.

### Summoning essences and pets

A summoning essence is recognised by what the server sends with it: every
essence belongs to one shared cooldown, `PluginInventoryItem.SummoningCooldownId`
(213), and `SharedCooldownId` carries the item's cooldown whether it came with
the object or in an appraisal. `IsPetDevice` is true for that cooldown, or
when a server names the pet the item summons in `PetClass`; the usual servers
keep `PetClass` to themselves, so it reads `0` there. `CooldownSeconds` is how
long the item's cooldown lasts once used, and `Spells.GetCooldownRemaining(
PluginInventoryItem.SummoningCooldownId)` says how long until the next summon.
`Items.ActiveOwnedPetCount` counts the living creatures the server names the
character as owner of.

Before summoning, `Navigation.CheckRoomAhead(3f)` asks whether a body the
size of the character fits three metres ahead (see
[navigation.md](navigation.md#where-things-are)).

### An appraisal the server refused, and a lost item

The server answers every appraisal, but not always with a description. An
unsuccessful answer carries nothing, and the client keeps whatever an earlier
answer delivered. Two members say which way the server answered:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PluginAppraisalState.CurrentObjectUnsuccessful` | The answer that completed `CurrentObjectId` was unsuccessful. Read it in the same poll that sees your `Identify` complete. False when nothing has completed and for an object the client does not hold. |
| `PluginWorldObject.LastAppraisalUnsuccessful` | The latest thing the server said about this object, whoever asked, was an unsuccessful appraisal answer. A successful answer clears it, and so does anything else the server sends about the object -- a fresh create, a property or stack-size update, a confirmed move or wield, a pack listing or inventory list naming it -- since each shows the server still has it. |

An unsuccessful answer does not by itself mean the object is gone. The server
also answers this way for an item made to resist appraisal (the client is
never told which items those are) and for a repeat request of the same object
sent within about five seconds of an unsuccessful one.

```csharp
PluginItemCommandResult result = host.Automation.Items.ForgetStaleItem(itemId);
```

`ForgetStaleItem` lets go of a carried item the server no longer has. The item
leaves the client the way it would if the server had deleted it -- out of its
pack, every inventory list and window, and `ObjectChanged` reports it
`Released` -- and nothing is sent to the server. It answers `Completed` when
the item is gone and refuses anything else:

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `InvalidItem` | Unknown id, the character itself, anything not carried, or an item the client holds no server record of. |
| `Refused` | The item is worn or wielded (either in an equipment slot or with a wielder), it is a pack that still holds anything (listed in it, or naming it as its container), `LastAppraisalUnsuccessful` is false for it, or the refusal came more than 30 seconds of game time ago. |
| `Busy` | An appraisal of this item is still awaited (its answer is the one that counts), or `IsBusy` reads true. `IsBusy` does not cover an appraisal in flight. |

Ask twice, more than five seconds apart, and drop an item refused both times
straight after the second refusal: an older refusal is not acted on, because
it may be the repeat-request refusal of a real item nobody has asked about
since. If the item did exist after all, the server describes it again the
next time it sends the inventory, at the latest on the next login. This is a
client-side step the original client does not have; it runs the same way on
both clients.

## Confirmations

```csharp
host.Events.ConfirmationRequested += confirmation =>
{
    // confirmation.ContextId, confirmation.Type, confirmation.Text
    host.Automation.Dialogs.Answer(confirmation.ContextId, accept: true);
};
```

`ConfirmationRequested` fires whenever the server asks the client to show a
yes/no confirmation dialog. `Type` is the server's raw wire value; the only
one with fixed, known meaning is `5`, the crafting-percent confirmation
("this has a chance to fail, continue?"). Every other value is server-defined
and only distinguishable by `Text`.

`Dialogs.Answer(contextId, accept)` answers the dialog exactly as the
client's own Yes/No buttons would — it drives the same response builder, so
the server sees the identical reply. It returns `false` when there is no
outstanding dialog with that context id (already answered, timed out, or the
id does not match).

## Session

```csharp
if (!host.Automation.Login.Logout())
{
    // no in-world session to log out of
}
```

`Login.RequestLogout()` runs the client's own graceful logout — the same
route the UI's logout control uses. `Login.Logout()` is an alias that
forwards to it. Poll `Login.CanRequestLogout` first: it is `false` when the
surface is not `IsAvailable` (no in-world session) and while a teleport,
portal entry or earlier logout is already in flight, and `RequestLogout()`
returns `false` in the same cases. A `true` return means the logoff request
was sent; it does not report the outcome beyond that.

On the graphical host this returns to the character-select screen with the
process still running. On the headless host there is no character-select
screen to return to: the session sends the logoff, waits for the server's
confirmation, and then ends. If no confirmation arrives within 45 seconds
the session ends with a runtime error instead. Either way a headless plugin
that calls it should expect the session to end, not to see another
character list.

## Allegiance

`host.Automation.Allegiance` reads the allegiance the server has told the
client about, and sends the two commands that change it.

```csharp
IAllegianceAutomation allegiance = host.Automation.Allegiance;

PluginAllegianceSnapshot mine = allegiance.Snapshot;
if (mine.IsKnown)
    host.Log.Info($"{mine.Name}, rank {mine.Rank}, {mine.MemberCount} members");

PluginAllegianceCommandResult sworn = allegiance.Swear(patronObjectId);
PluginAllegianceCommandResult broken = allegiance.Break(patronObjectId);

if (!sworn.Accepted)
    host.Log.Warn($"{sworn.Status}: {sworn.Notice}");
```

`Snapshot` carries the allegiance's `Name`, the character's own `Rank`,
`MemberCount` (the whole allegiance, monarch included) and `VassalCount`
(everyone sworn beneath the character, all the way down: its followers).
`Monarch` and `Patron` say who heads the allegiance and who the character is
sworn to, and `Vassals` lists the characters sworn directly to it, each as a
`PluginAllegianceMember`: object id, name, rank, level, `HeritageGroup` (1
Aluvian, 2 Gharu'ndim, 3 Sho, 4 Viamontian, ... as the server numbers it),
`Gender` (1 male, 2 female) and whether they were online when the server last
said. `Monarch` is the character itself when it heads the allegiance;
`Patron` is null for a monarch; both are null, and `Vassals` empty, until the
server has stated the allegiance.

The two commands are checked differently before they are sent, because they
mean different things:

- **`Swear`** pledges the character to another player as its patron, and
  swearing is done face to face. The id has to be a player the client can
  currently see standing in the world; anything else -- a creature, a door, a
  player the client only knows by name, a guid it has never heard of -- is
  refused as `InvalidTarget` and nothing leaves the client.
- **`Break`** breaks the tie between the character and someone in its
  allegiance: its patron, or one of its vassals. The id has to be someone the
  server has said is in that allegiance. It does **not** have to be nearby or
  even logged in, which is the ordinary case -- a patron a continent away is
  still a patron.

| `Status` | when |
|---|---|
| `Sent` | the command went to the server; its answer arrives later as a restated allegiance |
| `Unavailable` | the character is not in the world, or there is no session |
| `InvalidTarget` | a zero id, a patron who is not a visible player, or a break target outside the allegiance |
| `Refused` | the target was fine and the client still did not send it, for a reason of its own; see `Notice`. Never a statement about the target, so do not pick a different one on it |

`Sent` means the command left the client, not that it worked: the server
decides whether the character may swear or break -- experience owed, a
cooldown, a mansion held -- and says so in its own time. Watch `Snapshot`
rather than assuming, and note that `Snapshot` only changes once the server
sends the allegiance again.

## Fellowship

`host.Automation.Fellowship` reads the fellowship the server has told the
client about, and sends the commands the fellowship panel sends.

```csharp
IFellowshipAutomation fellowship = host.Automation.Fellowship;
if (fellowship.IsInFellowship)
{
    string terms = (fellowship.SharesExperience ? "" : "NOT ") + "Sharing XP"
        + (fellowship.SharesExperience && !fellowship.SplitsExperienceEvenly
            ? ", Uneven Split" : "");
    host.Log.Info($"{fellowship.Name} ({fellowship.MemberCount}): {terms}");
    foreach (PluginFellowMember member in fellowship.CaptureRoster())
        host.Log.Info($"  {member.Name} [{member.Level}]");
}
```

`SharesExperience` says whether the fellowship shares the experience its
members earn. `SplitsExperienceEvenly` says whether that shared experience is
split evenly or in proportion to the members' levels, which happens when
their levels are too far apart; it only means something while
`SharesExperience` is true. Each `PluginFellowMember` carries the member's
`Level` as the roster last reported it. `CaptureMembers` leaves out the
local player and anyone whose distance the client cannot work out right now;
`CaptureRoster` includes the local player's own entry. All of these read
false, zero or empty when there is no fellowship.

## Loot

A classifier is registered under `<pluginId>/<classifierId>` — the id a
plugin passes to `Register` is scoped by its own manifest id before other
plugins ever see it. A plugin that registers `"loot-rules"` is visible to the
rest of the client as `"<its plugin id>/loot-rules"`; use the scoped id, not
the bare one, when calling `TryNeedsIdentification` or
`TryClassifyWithProfile` from a different plugin.

Beyond the live-profile `Classify` a registered `IPluginLootClassifier`
already provides, two more members exist:

```csharp
bool blocked = host.LootClassifiers.TryNeedsIdentification(classifierId, context);

bool found = host.LootClassifiers.TryClassifyWithProfile(
    classifierId, "Vendor", context, out PluginLootClassification classification);
```

`NeedsIdentification` (and its registry forwarder `TryNeedsIdentification`)
reports whether an item cannot yet be classified with confidence: it lacks
appraisal data and at least one active rule needs an appraised property to
evaluate. A plugin can use this to hold off deciding until an identify
request completes.

`TryClassifyWithProfile` — both the classifier's own member and the
registry's forwarder of the same name — classifies against a *named, stored*
profile instead of the classifier's live one, such as VTank's "vendor" and
"trader" list files. It returns `false` when the named profile does not
exist; a classifier with no notion of named profiles defaults to the same.

`PluginLootAction` covers the original tool's full vocabulary, including its
two mana-transfer actions (`ManaStone`, `ManaTank`); a classifier reporting one
of those is a real match with `Matched` true and `RuleName` set, exactly
like any other action.

## Trade

```csharp
host.Automation.Trade.Opened += opened =>
{
    // opened.InitiatorObjectId (the local player), opened.PartnerObjectId
};
host.Automation.Trade.ItemAdded += added =>
{
    // added.ItemObjectId, added.Mine (true = staged on my side)
};
host.Automation.Trade.PartnerTradeAccepted += partnerId => { /* they hit accept */ };
host.Automation.Trade.Closed += () => { /* for any reason */ };

if (host.Automation.Trade.IsOpen)
{
    host.Automation.Trade.Add(itemObjectId);
    host.Automation.Trade.Accept();
}
```

`Trade` mirrors the retail-look secure-trade window one field at a time:
`IsOpen`, `PartnerObjectId`, `PartnerName`, `MyItems`, `PartnerItems`,
`MyAccepted`, `PartnerAccepted`. `Add`, `Accept`, `Decline`, `Reset`, and
`End` send the exact same wire commands the window's own buttons do, gated
the same way: each returns `PluginTradeCommandResult` with a
`PluginTradeCommandStatus` of `Unavailable` (no in-world session),
`NotOpen` (no trade window is open), `InvalidItem`, or `Sent`.

`Accept` is a no-op (returns `AlreadyAccepted` without touching the wire)
once `MyAccepted` is already true -- the same guard the window's own
Accept button has by disabling itself. `Decline`, `Reset`, and `End` carry
no such guard and always resend: a partner-declined round can be declined
again, and ending an already-closing trade is harmless.

The event named `PartnerTradeAccepted` — not `PartnerAccepted` — carries the
partner's object id when they accept. It could not be named `PartnerAccepted`
because that name is already the live acceptance flag; C# does not allow a
property and an event to share a name on one interface.

There is no wire bit for "who asked for this trade first": `Opened.
InitiatorObjectId` is always the local player's own object id, and
`PartnerObjectId` is always the other side, regardless of who actually sent
the open request.

A trade owner that registers a new partner while the window never closed
in between (one open trade replaced by another inside a single `Poll()`
interval) is reported as a `Closed` for the old partner immediately
followed by an `Opened` for the new one -- `Poll()` tracks the partner
guid, not just open/closed. Two or more such swaps landing inside the
same interval coalesce into a single close+open pair for the final
partner; an intermediate partner in that window is never individually
reported.

## Vendor

```csharp
host.Automation.Vendor.Opened += vendorId => { /* the shop pane just opened */ };
host.Automation.Vendor.TransactionCompleted += result =>
{
    // result.Kind (Buy/Sell), result.Success, result.Notice
};

foreach (PluginVendorItem item in host.Automation.Vendor.Items)
{
    // item.TemplateObjectId, item.Name, item.UnitPrice (retail sell-rate math -- the vendor's SellPrice, what it charges the player), item.StackSize
    // item.MaxStackSize  -- how many fit in one stack, so a purchase can be costed in pack slots
    // item.ItemType      -- the listing's category, comparable with Profile.DealsInItemTypes
}

PluginVendorProfile profile = host.Automation.Vendor.Profile;
// profile.BuyRate                         -- the share of an item's value this vendor pays you
// profile.DealsInItemTypes                -- the categories it buys, as a bit mask
// profile.MinimumValue / .MaximumValue    -- its per-unit value limits, or NoValueLimit
// profile.DealsInMagicalItems             -- whether it takes items carrying spells
// profile.UsesAlternateCurrency           -- and AlternateCurrencyWeenieClassId / Amount / Name

host.Automation.Vendor.AddToBuyList(templateObjectId, count: 1);
host.Automation.Vendor.BuyAll();

host.Automation.Vendor.AddToSellList(ownedItemObjectId);
host.Automation.Vendor.SellAll();
```

`Vendor.Items` lists what the shop currently has for sale, priced with the
same retail sell-rate formula the vendor window shows (quantity 1). Staging
is entirely local to this surface — `AddToBuyList` / `AddToSellList` and
their `Remove*` / `Clear*` counterparts never touch the wire — until
`BuyAll` or `SellAll` commits the staged list through the same builder the
window's own Buy All / Sell All buttons use, and clears the list on send. A
vendor selling a full stack sells however many of that item the character
currently owns, matching the window's own default. `TryCaptureProperties`
reads a listed item's already-materialized properties -- the data the
`ApproachVendor` listing itself carried, shaped like an appraisal but not a
live appraisal round trip -- by its `TemplateObjectId`, including the
`WeaponProfile`/`ArmorProfile` fields described under
[Weapon and armor profiles](#weapon-and-armor-profiles) when the listing
carries one.

`Vendor.Profile` is the open vendor's shop terms, which is what a plugin
needs to plan a visit before it walks in. `BuyRate` is the share of an
item's value this vendor pays when it buys **from** you — 0.75 means three
quarters of the item's value — so a payout is that rate times the item's
per-unit value, rounded **down** to whole coin but never down to nothing: a
payout that works out below one coin is paid as one. A trade note is always
paid at face value whatever the rate says. What the vendor *charges* is
already per listing, as `PluginVendorItem.UnitPrice`. `DealsInItemTypes` is
a bit mask of the categories it buys, comparable directly against a
listing's `ItemType` or an inventory item's: no shared bit means the vendor
refuses the item. `MinimumValue` and `MaximumValue` are its per-unit value
limits, each reading `PluginVendorProfile.NoValueLimit` when the vendor sets
no limit in that direction; an item worth nothing at all is refused whatever
they say, and a trade note is bought however far above `MaximumValue` it is,
so a pack filtered by that ceiling has to let notes through or it drops the
most valuable things the vendor would have taken. `UsesAlternateCurrency`
tells you to count `AlternateCurrencyWeenieClassId` rather than the
character's money; `AlternateCurrencyAmount` is how many of it the character
held when the listing arrived — a snapshot, not a live count — and
`AlternateCurrencyName` its plural name for a line you write. With no vendor
open the whole record is `PluginVendorProfile.Unset`: the rate zero, the
name null, and both value limits `NoValueLimit` rather than zero, because a
zero limit is a real one and an all-zero record would read as a vendor that
refuses everything. Check `IsOpen` first all the same.

`IsBusy` reports whether this adapter's own buy/sell is in flight -- it is
vendor-local, not the client-wide inventory-transaction busy state, which
a vendor transaction never touches. `BuyAll`/`SellAll` refuse with `Busy`
rather than queue behind an outstanding buy/sell of their own.

## Hotkeys

```csharp
IPluginHotkeyRegistration handle = host.Hotkeys.Register(
    "quick-heal",
    "Quick Heal",
    new PluginKeyChord(PluginKey.H, Ctrl: true),
    () => { /* Ctrl+H was pressed */ });

if (!handle.IsBound)
    host.Log.Warn("Quick Heal's default chord collided with a client binding.");
```

`Register` id is scoped by the plugin's own manifest id before the host ever
sees it, so two plugins registering `"quick-heal"` do not collide with each
other. A stored user override for the scoped id replaces the caller's
default chord at registration time; `handle.EffectiveChord` reports which
chord actually ended up bound. A chord that collides with an existing client
key binding is refused rather than silently stealing it: `handle.IsBound` is
`false` and the handler never fires. Disposing the handle revokes the
binding; the host also revokes every hotkey a plugin registered when that
plugin unloads.

A hotkey does not fire while the chat bar has keyboard focus unless Ctrl or
Alt is part of the chord — otherwise every letter typed into chat would also
be a candidate hotkey press.

Plugin hotkeys are a raw keyboard subscription, not a route through
InputDispatcher's action/scope engine (a dynamic per-plugin action space
large enough to fit that machinery would be a much bigger change than the
rest of this surface) -- documented deviation. Two dispatcher states still
suppress every hotkey, matching how the dispatcher itself would refuse to
route a client action in the same situations: a rebind capture in progress
(`InputDispatcher.BeginCapture`) and a modal `Dialog`/`EditField` scope
pushed on top (not just `Chat`, which has its own Ctrl/Alt carve-out
above).

The graphical host may receive a `Register` call before its keyboard and
input dispatcher exist yet (plugin loading is not strictly ordered against
input-dispatcher composition); the registration is queued and resolved the
moment the input layer comes up, so `IsBound` can flip from `false` to `true`
without the plugin doing anything further.

A chord that collides with another plugin's own already-bound hotkey is
refused the same way a client-binding collision is: first registered,
first bound. Registering the same scoped id a second time replaces the
first registration outright (the old handle's `IsBound` flips to false
and it stops firing) rather than adding a second live binding for that id.

`IPluginHotkeyRegistration.Rebind(chord)` stores a new chord as a user
override and re-resolves the registration immediately (headless treats it
as a no-op, matching its inert `Register`). Overrides persist to a
plugin-scoped `plugin-hotkeys.json`, keyed `<pluginId>:<hotkeyId>` --
sibling to, not inside, the client's own `keybinds.json` (the original
design sketch put overrides in `keybinds.json` itself; this was changed
so a corrupt or hand-edited plugin override file can never touch the
client's own binding schema). There is no in-client rebind UI yet; a
plugin (or a future Settings panel) calls `Rebind` directly.

## Host window

```csharp
if (host.Window.IsMinimized)
    host.Window.Restore();

HostWindowResult result = host.Window.Minimize();
if (!result.Succeeded)
    host.Log.Warn("could not minimize the client window.");
```

`host.Window` is one of the client's own OS window: minimize, restore, and
request-close, the same three controls the title bar already offers.

`Minimize()` sets the window to iconified; `Restore()` un-minimizes it if it
is currently minimized and is a no-op success otherwise -- it never forces
the window to a plain "Normal" state, because a window that was maximized
or fullscreen before it was minimized should come back maximized or
fullscreen, not windowed. Both report `HostWindowStatus.Done` only once the
window actually reports a state consistent with the request back, not just
because the call was made; a write that does not stick (no window focus, a
platform that refuses it) reports `Unavailable`.

That confirmation is not equally trustworthy on every platform. It is
synchronous on Windows. On X11 it arrives asynchronously over the window
manager's own state property, so a check immediately after `Minimize()` can
briefly still read the old state. On macOS the minimize animation means
there is a short window where the OS has not finished iconifying yet. On
Wayland the compositor protocol has no way to report iconification back to
the client at all, so `IsMinimized` never becomes `true` there and
`Minimize()` always reports `Unavailable` even when the window did minimize
-- treat `Unavailable` from `Minimize()` as "unknown", not as "definitely
still shown", and do not retry it in a loop on that signal alone.
`IsMinimized` itself reads a cached flag kept current by the window's own
state-change callback, not a live read of the window's state -- the same
window calls the writes above go through are documented main-thread-only,
so a live read from whatever thread a plugin happens to call this from
would carry the same silent-failure risk the write side already has to
guard against.

`RequestClose()` takes the exact route the window's own close button uses:
graceful logout, then teardown, then process exit. It never terminates the
process directly -- there is no `Environment.Exit`/`Process.Kill` on this
path, on either host. On a host with no window (headless), `Minimize`,
`Restore`, and `IsMinimized` stay at the interface's inert defaults
(`Unavailable`/`false`), but `RequestClose` still has somewhere real to go:
it ends the plugin's own session -- not the whole headless process -- the
same way a bot policy already ends its own session when it decides its job
is done. A second session hosted by the same process is untouched; only the
console's own `/quit` and a SIGINT/SIGTERM end every session in the process
at once. Without `--console` there is no `/quit` to type, so
`Window.RequestClose()` is the one graceful way a plugin has to end its own
headless session from the inside.

## World labels

```csharp
host.Automation.Labels.ShowLabels(
[
    new PluginWorldLabel(creatureId, "Drudge Slinker", new Vector4(1f, 0.9f, 0.3f, 1f)),
    new PluginWorldLabel(creatureId, "14 m", new Vector4(1f, 1f, 1f, 1f), Line: 1),
]);
```

`Labels.ShowLabels` hangs one line of text over each named object, at a
constant screen size, and follows the object as it moves. A call replaces
the plugin's whole set: push what should be showing now, push an empty list
to clear. The set is copied, so the list can be reused.

The client works out how tall each object is; `HeightOffset` is metres added
on top of that, and `Line` counts lines upward from the object's head so two
labels on one object stack without either knowing the font. `MaxRange` is
the distance from the camera, in metres, past which the label is not drawn;
it fades over the last fifth. When labels overlap, the nearer object's label
is drawn on top.

Each plugin may have at most `IWorldLabelAutomation.MaximumLabels` (256)
labels showing. A larger set is refused as a whole -- `ShowLabels` returns
false and the labels already showing stay -- rather than trimmed, so the
plugin finds out. Inside an accepted set, a label with a zero object id, no
text, text longer than `IWorldLabelAutomation.MaximumTextLength` (128
characters), a colour component or height offset that is not a finite
number, or a range that is not a positive finite number is dropped and the
rest are shown. A label over an object the client does not hold is simply
not drawn until the object appears.

Labels are not occluded: a label shows through a wall, a hill or another
object. The interface is drawn after the world with no depth to test
against, and there is no cheap way to ask whether an object is behind cover.
A plugin that wants a label to disappear with its object has to decide that
itself, from the object's position and its own knowledge of the place.

The set belongs to the session: when the character leaves the world, every
plugin's labels are dropped, and a plugin that is unloaded takes its labels
with it.
## Images

A plugin that draws its own map or HUD gets its images through
`host.Ui.Images`. There are four sources and no raw pixel uploads:

```csharp
IPluginImages images = host.Ui.Images;

PluginImage art   = images.FromClientArt(0x06001234u);   // client art by surface id, or a bare index
PluginImage spell = images.FromSpellIcon(spellId);        // the icon the spell bar draws
PluginImage item  = images.FromObjectIcon(objectId);      // the icon the inventory draws, layers and all
PluginImage own   = images.FromStream("art/compass.png",  // the plugin's own art, decoded by the host
    () => File.OpenRead(Path.Combine(pluginDirectory, "art", "compass.png")));

if (own.IsValid) { /* own.Width, own.Height */ }
images.Release(own);
```

Every request is counted once per distinct thing asked for and held as
many times as it was asked for: asking twice for the same surface returns
the same `PluginImage`, and it takes two releases to let it go. The plugin
may hold at most `MaximumCount` images (256), and its own decoded art at
most `MaximumBytes` (32 MB) of texture memory, with no image wider or
taller than `MaximumDimension` (2048). A request past any of these answers
`PluginImage.None` and is reported once in the client's log. Client art
and composed icons are shared with the client's own windows and every
other plugin, so they cost nothing against the byte budget.

`FromStream` accepts PNG, JPEG, BMP, TGA and GIF; the stream is opened only
when the host does not already hold an image under that name, and disposed
by the host. Call all of this from the tick thread, as with every other UI
call. Without a window, or before the client's interface is up,
`IsAvailable` is false and every request answers `PluginImage.None`;
images are dropped when the interface is torn down (for example on a
reconnect), after which the plugin asks again.

## Canvases

A canvas is a rectangle the plugin paints, shown over the world and under
every window, taking no input unless it asks for it (see
[Pointer input](#pointer-input) below). It is positioned by an anchor plus
an offset, it is exactly its declared size, and everything painted is
clipped to it; there is no way to draw anywhere else on the screen.

```csharp
IPluginCanvas hud = host.Ui.RegisterCanvas(
    new PluginCanvasDescriptor("hud", 200, 60)
    {
        Anchor = PluginCanvasAnchor.BottomRight,
        Offset = new PluginPoint(-10, -10),
    },
    painter =>
    {
        painter.Clear(PluginColor.Transparent);
        painter.FillRect(new PluginRect(0, 0, painter.Width, painter.Height), new PluginColor(0, 0, 0, 160));
        painter.DrawText($"{vitals.Health} / {vitals.MaximumHealth}", new PluginPoint(6, 4), PluginColor.White, outline: true);
        painter.DrawImageTransformed(compass, new PluginRect(150, 10, 40, 40), PluginColor.White,
            rotationRadians: heading, pivot: new PluginPoint(20, 20));
    });

// later, whenever what it shows has changed:
hud.Invalidate();
```

Painting is **retained**: the host keeps what was last painted and calls
the paint callback again only after `Invalidate()`, at most once per
frame, on the tick thread. Several `Invalidate()` calls before that frame
paint once. The painter handed to the callback is valid only for the
duration of the call; keeping it and drawing later throws. Its primitives
are `Clear`, `FillRect`, `StrokeRect`, `DrawLine`, `DrawText` with
`MeasureText` (the client's own interface font, one size), `DrawImage`,
`DrawImageTransformed` (scaled and turned about a pivot, for a compass or
a rotating map) and `PushClip`/`PopClip`; every clip pushed must be popped
before the callback returns.

A paint callback is measured. One that stays over its 4 ms budget on three
frames in a row, throws, or leaves a clip pushed is dropped for the rest
of the session and the canvas hidden; the client's log says why. A plugin
may register at most 8 canvases, each with an id unique within the plugin;
`RegisterCanvas` throws past either. `IsVisible`, `Anchor` and `Offset`
can be set at any time; disposing the canvas removes it, and everything a
plugin still holds is removed when the plugin unloads.

Without a window the canvas is accepted, `IsAvailable` is false, the
state the plugin sets is kept, and the paint callback is never called.

### Pointer input

A canvas is click-through by default. One that wants to be dragged,
zoomed at the cursor or clicked opts in with `AcceptsPointerInput` on the
descriptor and sets a `PointerHandler` on the canvas; input and
click-through are the two states of one switch, and input wins: while the
canvas is shown and has a handler, everything the pointer does inside the
canvas's rectangle goes to the handler and no further, and the world
beneath gets no mouse there. Outside the rectangle nothing changes.
Without a handler an opted-in canvas stays click-through, since nobody is
listening.

```csharp
IPluginCanvas map = host.Ui.RegisterCanvas(
    new PluginCanvasDescriptor("map", 300, 300) { AcceptsPointerInput = true },
    painter => DrawMap(painter));

PluginPoint? dragFrom = null;
map.PointerHandler = e =>
{
    switch (e.Kind)
    {
        case PluginPointerEventKind.Down when e.Button == PluginPointerButton.Left:
            dragFrom = e.Position;
            break;
        case PluginPointerEventKind.Move when dragFrom is { } from:
            bool measuring = (e.Modifiers & PluginKeyModifiers.Shift) != 0;
            Pan(e.Position.X - from.X, e.Position.Y - from.Y, measuring);
            dragFrom = e.Position;
            map.Invalidate();
            break;
        case PluginPointerEventKind.Up or PluginPointerEventKind.Cancelled:
            dragFrom = null;
            break;
        case PluginPointerEventKind.Wheel:
            ZoomAbout(e.Position, e.WheelDelta);
            map.Invalidate();
            break;
    }
};
```

Every event arrives on the tick thread as a `PluginPointerEvent`: its
`Kind` (`Down`, `Up`, `Move`, `Wheel`, `Cancelled`), its `Position` in
the canvas's own pixels from its top-left corner, whatever anchor, offset
or interface scale the canvas is shown at, the `Button` it is about
(`Left`, `Right`, `Middle`, or `None` for the wheel), the `Modifiers`
held (`Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`, as flags) and, for the wheel, a
`WheelDelta` in notches, positive away from the user. A press inside the
canvas holds the pointer until the button comes up: `Move` events keep
coming with that button, and the position may lie outside the rectangle,
so a fast drag never loses the canvas. A move with nothing held is not
reported. The wheel reaches the canvas only while the pointer is over it.
`Cancelled` means a press ended without its `Up`: the canvas was hidden
or removed, or the host took the pointer for something else; treat it as
the end of the drag. `ReleasePointer()` ends the press the canvas holds
on the plugin's own say-so, from inside the handler or anywhere else;
nothing more arrives for that press, and no `Cancelled` is sent for a
release the plugin asked for.

The handler is measured like the paint callback, against the interface's
2 ms frame budget: one that stays over it on three events in a row, or
throws, is dropped for the rest of the session and the canvas goes back to
click-through; painting continues and the client's log says why. The
handler is dropped with the paint callback when the canvas is disposed.

Without a window `AcceptsPointerInput` and the handler are kept, the
handler is never called, and `ReleasePointer()` does nothing.

## Dungeon map

```csharp
IDungeonMapAutomation map = host.Automation.DungeonMap;
uint landblock = map.CurrentLandblockId;
if (landblock != 0u && map.IsSealedDungeon(here.CellId))
{
    PluginDungeonFloorplan plan = map.CaptureFloorplan(landblock);
    foreach (PluginDungeonLayer layer in plan.Layers)
        foreach (PluginDungeonWall wall in layer.Walls)
            DrawLine(wall.Start, wall.End);
}
```

`DungeonMap` is the shape of the place the character is in, as data: the
plugin draws it however it likes. `CurrentLandblockId` is the landblock the
character's body is in, with a zero low half, or zero before there is a body.
`IsSealedDungeon` is true for an indoor cell that sees nothing outside, as a
dungeon's cells are, and false for the landscape, for a building interior
that opens onto it, and for a cell the game data lacks.

`CaptureFloorplan` builds a landblock's plan from the cell geometry in the
game data the first time it is asked and hands back the same object every
time after, so a plugin may ask every frame. Every cell's structure is placed
by the cell's own position and turn and flattened onto the ground: a level
face that faces up is floor, a standing face is a wall seen edge-on as a
line, and the doorways the data lists between cells are left open. Cells are
grouped into `Layers` by height, six metres to a band and shifted down three,
so a storey reads as a layer; each layer has its floor polygons and its wall
lines, collinear runs already joined. `Cells` names every cell with its
middle and its layer, and `BoundsMin`/`BoundsMax` box the whole plan.

Everything is in the landblock's own frame, in metres: x east and y north
from the landblock's south-west corner, which is the frame the game's cell
positions use. `PluginDungeonFloorplan.ToLandblockLocal` puts a position from
`Navigation` into that frame; compare the position's landblock with the
plan's before drawing it on the plan. The plan is built once and never
changed, so it is safe to keep and to read from any thread.

The plan is derived from geometry, not drawn by hand, so on a dungeon whose
rooms are authored as sloped or stepped structures the floor and wall
classification can be rougher than a hand-made map; a plugin should expect
polygons to overlap where cells meet and fill them rather than stitch them.
`PluginDungeonFloorplan.Empty` comes back for a landblock the data does not
have, for one with no indoor cells, and on a client with no lease on the
game data.

`CaptureIndoorCells` is the raw placement instead, for a plugin that draws
dungeons from tiles of its own, one per environment piece: every cell the
landblock's data lists, in cell id order, as a `PluginIndoorCell` with the
`EnvironmentId` the cell is built from (the low sixteen bits of the
environment file's id, as the cell stores it), its `CellStructure`, the
piece's `Origin` in the same landblock-local metres, its `Orientation`
quaternion exactly as stored (the data stores W, X, Y, Z in that order) and
`SeesOutside` (false for a sealed dungeon's cell). `YawDegrees` turns the
orientation into a turn about the vertical axis, 0 up to 360 counted from
east towards north, which for dungeon pieces is 0, 90, 180 or 270 to within
rounding. Cells without geometry, which the floorplan leaves out, are here
too. The list is read once per landblock and the same list is handed back
after; it is empty whenever the floorplan would be.

## Clients on this computer

```csharp
INetworkAutomation peers = host.Automation.Network;
foreach (PluginNetworkClient client in peers.CaptureClients())
{
    if (client.Tags.Contains("healer", StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        Console.WriteLine($"{client.Name} on {client.WorldName}: {client.CurrentHealth}/{client.MaxHealth}");
}
```

`Network` is for playing several characters side by side: each client
running on this computer publishes a little about its own character, and
reads what the others published, so a plugin can tell where the group's
other characters are, how they are doing, and what they have just cast.
Nothing here goes to the game server and nothing leaves the machine. The
clients find each other through the file system: each one leaves a small
note in a `plugin-peers` folder beneath its data directory, rewritten about
every five seconds while the character is in the world and withdrawn on
the next heartbeat after it leaves. So two clients see each other only when they share a data
directory (`docs/plugin-development.md` says where it is); two pointed at
different ones never meet. There is no discovery beyond that folder, and
none is needed.

`IsAvailable` is true on both clients for the whole session. `CaptureClients`
answers the other clients on this computer, never the caller's own, sorted
by character name. A note that has not been rewritten in the last fifteen
seconds is treated as gone, so a client that crashed or was killed drops
out of the list within that window rather than lingering; a note that is
malformed or over 64 KB is skipped. Every record is a snapshot of what that
client last wrote, up to five seconds old, and reading it costs a scan of
the folder, so read it on a heartbeat of your own rather than every tick.

A `PluginNetworkClient` carries:

- `ClientId`, a stable non-zero number for that client instance for as long
  as it runs (a client relaunched gets a new one), and `PlayerId`, its
  character's object id;
- `Name` and `WorldName`;
- `Position`, a `PluginNavigationPosition` with cell, coordinates,
  elevation and whether it is outdoors, and `Heading` in degrees clockwise
  from north, as of that client's last note;
- current and maximum health, mana and stamina;
- `Tags`, the words the player started that client with -- `ACDREAM_PLUGIN_TAGS`
  on the windowed client, `pluginTags` in the headless configuration, as
  `docs/building-and-running.md` describes. Tags are trimmed, de-duplicated
  ignoring case and capped at 128; a client started without any publishes an
  empty list. They mean whatever the plugin decides they mean: a role, a
  group name, a job for a bot. The player sets them at startup and a plugin
  can replace them with `SetTags`, below.

### Tags

```csharp
peers.SetTags(["healer", "buffbot"]);
```

`SetTags` replaces the labels this client answers to, whatever it was started
with. The labels are trimmed, blank ones dropped, repeats ignoring case
folded together and the list capped at 128; an empty list clears them. It
returns false for a null list and for a label longer than 64 characters,
which is refused outright rather than cut short. The change goes into this
client's note on the next tick, so the other clients see it within a
heartbeat, and it takes effect for broadcast commands straight away.

Labels are the only addressing the channel has: a broadcast aimed at labels
reaches a client wearing one of them and nobody else.

### Broadcast commands

```csharp
// On the client giving the orders:
peers.BroadcastCommand("/myplugin follow", ["healer"], delayMilliseconds: 250);

// On any client, to watch what was asked rather than let a verb answer it:
long cursor = 0L;
foreach (PluginPeerCommand command in peers.CaptureCommands(cursor))
{
    cursor = command.Sequence;
    Console.WriteLine($"{command.SenderObjectId} asked for {command.Line}");
}
```

`BroadcastCommand` asks the other clients on this computer to run a line,
exactly as though the player had typed it into the chat entry there. It is
the one free-form channel between clients, and it is not limited to plugin
verbs: the receiving client submits the line through its own chat entry, so

- the client's **own commands** are consulted first (`/loc`, `/pos`, the
  whole client catalogue), and no plugin can shadow one;
- then the **chat input interceptors** plugins have installed, which may
  rewrite or suppress the line;
- then the **verbs** plugins and the client have registered;
- and anything left is **dispatched** as typed speech is: to a channel, to a
  tell, or to the server as a server command.

So `BroadcastCommand("/loc", …)`, `BroadcastCommand("@tell Bob, hi", …)` and
`BroadcastCommand("hello", …)` all do on the receiving client what typing
them there would do.

The delivery is the client's own, not a plugin's. Every client reads the
notes four times a second, takes the lines aimed at labels it answers to, and
submits each one through the same entry a typed line goes in by. So a
broadcast is answered the same way on every client, whatever plugins happen
to be loaded there, and a plugin that registers a verb has that verb
reachable from another character without doing anything else.

The rules the host applies before a line is run:

- a line from a client logged in to a **different world** is skipped, as a
  cast is;
- this client's **own** broadcast is never run here. A plugin that wants the
  line run on the sending client too runs it there itself;
- a line aimed at **labels** is taken only by a client wearing one of them;
  a line aimed at none is taken by every client in the same world;
- a line **older than fifteen seconds**, or stamped that far in the future,
  is dropped, along with the rest of that note's command ring if any line in
  it is malformed. A malformed ring costs that client its ring and nothing
  else: its casts and its position are still read.

`delayMilliseconds` staggers the recipients so several characters do not act
on the same instant. Every client that takes the line orders itself against
the other recipients by client id, with the sender holding the first place,
and waits its own place in that order times the delay: the first recipient
waits one delay, the second two, and so on. Each recipient works its own
place out from the notes in the folder, so nothing has to be agreed in
advance. Zero has every recipient run it as soon as it reads it. A client
the line is not aimed at takes no place in the order.

`BroadcastCommand` returns false, and nothing is published, for an empty
line, a line longer than 512 characters or carrying a control character,
more than 16 labels or one longer than 64 characters, a delay below zero or
above sixty seconds, and a character that is not in the world.

`CaptureCommands` hands back the same lines for a plugin to read, oldest
first, with a `Sequence` cursor that behaves exactly like the cast one: hand
the highest back and each line arrives once, and reading consumes nothing, so
several plugins can each keep a cursor and none of them stops the client
running the lines. Each `PluginPeerCommand` carries the publishing
`ClientId`, the `SenderObjectId`, the `Tags` the line was aimed at, the
`Line` itself and `SentAt`, the instant the sending client said it asked.
The caps mirror the cast ring: a note carries its last 32 lines and a reader
keeps up to 128 unread ones, inside the same fifteen-second window.

### Cast sharing

```csharp
long cursor = 0L;
host.Events.Tick += _ =>
{
    foreach (PluginPeerCast cast in peers.CaptureCasts(cursor))
    {
        cursor = cast.Sequence;
        if (cast.Landed)
            host.Automation.Enchantments.ReportCast(
                cast.TargetObjectId, cast.SpellId, cast.SecondsRemaining);
        else
            HoldOff(cast.TargetObjectId, cast.SpellId);
    }
};

// When this character starts a spell, and again when it lands:
peers.AnnounceCastAttempt(targetId, spellId, effectiveSkill);
peers.AnnounceCastSuccess(targetId, spellId, effectiveSkill, durationSeconds);
```

Two characters buffing the same group, or debuffing the same creature, will
happily land the same spell twice unless they tell each other. The
announcements ride in the same note as the client record. `AnnounceCastAttempt`
says this character has begun a spell at a target, before it is known
whether it lands, so a second character can decide not to start the same
one; `AnnounceCastSuccess` says it landed and how long the effect lasts.
An announcement goes out as soon as a quarter of a second has passed since
the last note was written -- a burst of casts shares one write rather than
costing one each -- and both return true once the cast is accepted for
publishing, not when a peer has read it.

`CaptureCasts` hands back what the other clients said, oldest first. Each
cast carries a `Sequence` that only grows, in the order this client first
read it: hand the highest one back on the next call and each cast arrives
exactly once. A read does not consume anything -- several plugins share one
client, and each keeps its own cursor -- so `CaptureCasts(0)` always
answers everything still recent. Sequences can skip: a peer cast this client
could not make sense of is counted and then dropped. What comes back:

- `ClientId` and `CasterObjectId` -- the publishing client and its
  character -- `TargetObjectId`, `SpellId`, and `EffectiveSkill`, the magic
  skill the caster said it was casting with, or zero when it said nothing;
- `Landed`: true for a success, false for an attempt that may still fizzle
  or be resisted;
- `SecondsRemaining`, already age-adjusted: the duration the caster
  published, less however long ago it said the cast happened, never below
  zero. A success read five seconds after it landed reads five seconds
  shorter, so it can go straight into `Enchantments.ReportCast` as the
  duration. An attempt carries no duration and always reads zero.

None of it is authoritative: it is what the other client believed about its
own cast, not a fact from the server, so treat it as a hint about what is
already on a target. Nothing is applied to this client's own bookkeeping by
reading it; a plugin that wants a landed cast counted as an effect in place
passes it to `Enchantments.ReportCast` itself, as above.

The host checks every peer cast before handing it over and drops:

- casts from a client logged in to a **different world**, compared by world
  name ignoring case -- its object ids name other creatures entirely, so
  `CaptureCasts` is empty when no other client on this computer is in the
  same world;
- the client's **own** casts, so a character never reads its own
  announcements back as somebody else's;
- a **spell this client's own spell table cannot identify**. The id is the
  only thing carried; everything about the spell is looked up here, never
  believed from the note;
- a cast **older than fifteen seconds**, or stamped more than fifteen
  seconds in the future by a note whose clock cannot be trusted;
- a note whose cast ring has any malformed entry -- a zero caster, target or
  spell, a negative skill, a duration that is not a finite number of seconds
  between zero and a day, a success with no duration. One bad entry refuses
  that client's whole cast ring, because an honest client never writes one;
  its broadcast lines and its position are still read, being written through
  other code.

The announce side is held to the same rule, so a cast this client would
refuse to read is one it never writes. `AnnounceCastAttempt` and
`AnnounceCastSuccess` return false, and nothing is published, for a zero
target, a spell this client's spell table does not know, a negative skill,
a character that is not in the world, and -- for a success -- a duration
that is not a finite positive number of seconds or is longer than a day.
The day is a sanity limit rather than a game rule: nothing lasts that long,
and a reader that believed a longer one would hold a target as enchanted
for ever.

The caps: a client's note carries its last 32 casts, and a reader keeps up
to 128 unread ones from all peers together, so a plugin that polls slower
than the group casts can miss some. Fifteen seconds is the window for
everything: a cast older than that is gone whether or not it was read, and
so is a client not heard from. A plugin polling on every tick, or every
second, sees every cast; one polling every twenty seconds does not.

What the surface does **not** carry yet: what a peer is holding or how many
of something it has, its enchantments, or its target. A plugin that needs to
tell another client something the record does not say can send it as a
broadcast command line and answer it with a verb of its own.

Both clients publish and read the same way, from the same data-directory
rule and on the same heartbeat, so a windowed client and a headless bot on
one machine see each other. Cast sharing needs the spell table on both
sides: on a session without the installed data files -- see the "Headless"
section -- `AnnounceCastAttempt` and `AnnounceCastSuccess` return false and
`CaptureCasts` is empty, while `CaptureClients` is real either way.

### Relaying to other computers

```csharp
// Outgoing: what this client tells its neighbours, for your own transport.
if (peers.TryCaptureSelf(out PluginNetworkClient self))
    Send(self);
foreach (PluginPeerCast cast in peers.CaptureOwnCasts(ownCastCursor))
{
    Send(cast);
    ownCastCursor = cast.Sequence;
}
foreach (PluginPeerCommand line in peers.CaptureOwnCommands(ownLineCursor))
{
    Send(line);
    ownLineCursor = line.Sequence;
}

// Incoming: what arrived from a character on another computer.
peers.ImportRemoteClient(received);                // at least every few seconds
peers.ImportRemoteCast(caster, target, spell, skill, secondsLeft, landed);
peers.ImportRemoteCommand(sender, "/myplugin follow", ["healer"], 250);
```

The host never talks to another computer itself, but a plugin with a
transport of its own (a web socket, a chat channel) can carry the bus
further. `TryCaptureSelf` builds the record this client puts in its note,
on demand, with `IsRemote` false; it returns false while the character is
not in the world or its position is not known yet. `CaptureOwnCasts` and
`CaptureOwnCommands` hand back what this client itself announced with
`AnnounceCastAttempt`, `AnnounceCastSuccess` and `BroadcastCommand`, oldest
first, under this client's own sequence (not the numbering `CaptureCasts`
uses), for fifteen seconds and at most the last 32 of each, and only
while the character that announced them is in the world: they are dropped
as it leaves, so the next character starts with none.
`SecondsRemaining` on an own cast is what is left of the announced
duration, in seconds, and zero for an attempt.

`ImportRemoteClient` adds or refreshes a peer keyed by its `PlayerId`; the
`ClientId` and `IsRemote` it is given are ignored, and this client assigns
the peer a `ClientId` of its own that stays the same while the peer keeps
being imported. The peer then appears in `CaptureClients` with `IsRemote`
true, and it goes stale fifteen seconds after its last import, exactly as a
neighbour that stops writing does, so import each peer at least every few
seconds. `ImportRemoteCast` and `ImportRemoteCommand` accept only a caster or
sender imported within the last fifteen seconds; the cast or line then
appears in `CaptureCasts` or `CaptureCommands` with `IsRemote` true, under
the same world and label rules as a neighbour's, and an imported line aimed
at this client is run through its chat entry exactly as a neighbour's is. A
landed cast's `secondsRemaining` is what is left at the moment of the
import; an attempt's is ignored. An imported line's stagger counts only the
clients on this computer, since an imported peer's `ClientId` means nothing
outside this client.

The rules a note is read under apply to imports: each refuses what a
neighbour's note would be refused for (a zero id, a blank name, a position
that is not a number, an over-long label or line, a spell this client's
table does not know), and `ImportRemoteClient` refuses this client's own
character, a character here that is not in the world, and a new peer while
256 imported peers are still recent. A character this client already sees
in a recent note on this computer, in the same world, is read from that
note, and what is imported for it meanwhile is passed over for good: a relay
that echoes a neighbour back does not list it twice, count its casts twice
or run its lines twice, even after the neighbour logs out and the imported
copy shows again. The other way round, a note that shows up for a character
the relay was already carrying starts after what its rings held then.
Imports stay in this client: they are not written to its note, so each
client that wants remote peers runs a relay of its own.

An imported peer is known by its `PlayerId` alone, which the server numbers
per world: two characters in different worlds that share an id are one
imported peer to this client, and a remote character whose id is this
client's own is refused. A relay that spans worlds keeps to one world per
client.

**An imported line runs as if it were typed.** Whatever a plugin hands
`ImportRemoteCommand` goes through this client's chat entry: client
commands, other plugins' verbs, tells, and anything the server accepts from
this character, admin commands included. The only check the host makes is
that the sender was imported in the last fifteen seconds, and the relay
controls that too. Authenticate the transport and import lines only from
senders you trust; a relay that cannot vouch for its peers should import
their state and casts and leave their lines out.

## Headless

A windowless client binds this same surface through the same binding pass the
windowed one runs, from the same `GameRuntime`. That is not a claim in prose:
a seam census compares what the two clients can supply, member by member, and
fails on any difference that is not listed below with a reason. **So the rule
is the short one: everything on `IAutomationSurface` is real without a window
except what this section names.**

### Not available without a window

Nothing on `IAutomationSurface` is missing because a client has no window.

The selection also lets go of its object on both clients: when the server
takes the selected object out of the world, or stops showing it, `Selection`
clears rather than keeping a guid nothing will answer to. That used to happen
only where there was something drawing the object.

`Projectiles.EvaluatePath` is answered on both clients from the session's own
collision world. It answers `Unavailable` only outside the world, or while the
collision data around the character is not loaded -- a client with no lease on
the installed data files never has it. `Unavailable` means the flight was not
tested; it does not mean the flight is blocked.

`Labels.ShowLabels` is taken on both clients, with the same validation and
the same cap. A windowless client keeps the set and has nothing to draw it
with; a plugin cannot tell the two apart through this surface.

### Walking to something and then using it

`Items.Use` on a world object out of reach walks to it, sends the use once
the character is there, and gives up on a walk that has stopped getting
anywhere -- all of it one runtime owner, driven once a frame from the
per-frame local-player step, so all of it happens on a client with no
window too. `Loot.Open` on a corpse or a chest out in the world takes that
same route, so opening a corpse and using it are the same walk and the same
send on the same object. An openable container the plugin owns is still
opened where it is, since there is nowhere to walk to.

### Busy means "not yet", and `IsBusy` tells you when

`Items.IsBusy` and `Loot.IsBusy` answer one question: would a command
offered right now come back `Busy`? Two things put them there.

- **A request of your own is still in flight.** The client sends one item
  request at a time and waits for the server's answer. Clears when that
  answer arrives.
- **The pacing between two uses.** The client keeps a fifth of a second
  between one use and the next, the same on both clients and off the same
  clock. Closing one corpse and opening the next are two uses, so the
  second one runs into this even though nothing is in flight.

Both mean "not yet", never "no". A command refused this way has not
failed: it should not count against an attempt limit, and it should not
arm a back-off. Wait for `IsBusy` to read false and ask again -- a looter
that treated the pacing as a failure spent whole seconds standing between
one corpse and the next.

There is no busy-changed event. `IsBusy` is polled, like the rest of the
surface: read it on the `Tick` you were going to act on anyway. If your
own heartbeat is slower than the pacing, you will never see the pacing at
all.

`IsBusy` never reads false while a command would be refused as busy. It
can read true slightly longer than a move or a merge strictly needs,
because those do not take the use pacing -- asking a moment later costs a
fifth of a second at worst, and never a wrong answer.

`Equipment.IsBusy` and `Vendor.IsBusy` are separate channels with their
own meaning; see their own members.

### How distances are measured

Every distance a plugin is handed between two objects is the straight
line between them, centre to centre, in metres, with height included:
`Combat`'s `PluginCombatTarget.Distance`, `Loot`'s
`PluginLootContainer.Distance` and `Fellowship`'s
`PluginFellowMember.Distance` all read the same way. So something three
metres away along the ground and four metres above reads as five metres,
not three, and a corpse on the storey below does not read as lying at
your feet. `PluginCombatTarget.HeightDifference` is the height term on
its own, for a plugin that wants to leave other floors alone.

The one deliberate exception says so in its name.
`PluginNavigationPosition.HorizontalDistanceMeters` measures along the
ground and ignores height, because it answers a walking question: how far
the character has to travel, not how far away the thing is.
`Navigation.TryFindObject`'s radius is measured the same way, and is
documented as such.

### Planning a navigation path

`host.Automation.Navigation.PreviewPathAsync(objectId, arrivalMeters)` and its
`PluginNavigationPosition` overload preview where the client would route from
the character's current position. They work in graphical and headless hosts
with collision data loaded. A position overload uses its cell and elevation
to select the destination floor, including an indoor floor. An elevation of
NaN asks for the ground there. Arrival distance must be above zero and at
most 50 metres.

Start each preview from the thread that raises `host.Events.Tick`. The call
reads game state and captures collision synchronously; only grid building and
route search run on a worker. After an `await`, schedule any further preview
from a later Tick, since the continuation may run on a worker.

```csharp
// In a Tick handler:
Task<PluginNavigationPlan> pending = host.Automation.Navigation
    .PreviewPathAsync(targetId, 2.5f);
// Check pending.IsCompleted on a later Tick, or await outside the handler.
PluginNavigationPlan plan = await pending;
if (plan.Status == PluginNavigationPlanStatus.Routed)
    foreach (PluginNavigationPosition point in plan.Path)
        UseRoutePoint(point);
```

`Path` contains ordered route leg points with cell ids, map coordinates and
elevation. `LengthMeters` is the planned route length. The path is empty for
`NoRoute`, `Unavailable`, `InvalidTarget` and `Failed`; `Reason` explains the outcome.
`Failed` reports an error during grid building or route search, separate from
a destination that has no route.
The preview does not move the character, own navigation or change an active
walk. It snapshots currently loaded collision and nearby objects, so a path
may become stale. It covers one planning region, up to 320 metres outdoors or
2,048 metres across a sealed dungeon; it does not plan a multi-stage outdoor
walk or portal travel. Grid building and route search run asynchronously,
which matters for large dungeon grids. See [navigation.md](navigation.md#path-previews)
for planning details.

### Available, but only with the installed data files

A windowless session holds a lease on the installed data files only when it
was configured with content, and several parts of the surface are read out of
those files. On a content-less bot they answer rather than act, where a client
with a window does the work:

- `Navigation`'s walks, path previews and `CheckRoomAhead` need the
  collision data the files carry; without it `CheckRoomAhead` answers
  `Unknown`. Everything else on `Navigation` -- the snapshot, the
  move channels, `FaceHeading`, `Jump`, `TryFindObject` -- is real either way.
- `Spells` and `Magic` come from the spell catalogue, so a content-less
  session knows no spells and casts nothing by name.
- Skill names and skill icons come from the skill table: without it a plugin
  sees the character's skills unnamed.
- The species a creature belongs to, and the colours a character was made
  with, come from the same files.
- `State.Contracts` is answered either way, and the character's contracts,
  their stages and their progress are real on a content-less session. What
  comes out of the files is the authored words about them: without the
  files `Name`, `Description` and `Status` are empty strings and a plugin
  has the contract id and nothing to read out.
- How much of a skill the server credits the character with is worked out from
  formulas in those files. Without them a content-less session reads its own
  skills below what the server allows it -- which also means it runs at the
  speed those lower numbers give.
- `DungeonMap` reads a cell's kind and a landblock's floorplan out of the
  same files. Without them `IsSealedDungeon` is false and `CaptureFloorplan`
  is empty; `CurrentLandblockId` comes from the character's body and is real
  either way.
- `Network`'s cast sharing classifies every spell in the same catalogue, so
  without it `AnnounceCastAttempt` and `AnnounceCastSuccess` return false
  and `CaptureCasts` is empty. `CaptureClients` and this client's own note
  to the other clients on the machine are real either way.

Other creatures' bodies come off the same lease. The server says where a
creature is a few times a second and every client fills the gaps itself from
the cycle that creature is playing, which needs the animation content those
files carry. So a session with a lease reads another creature's position from
its body, moving between updates, on both clients alike -- `Objects`,
`Navigation.TryGetObject` and every position a plugin is handed. A
content-less bot has no bodies to carry and reads the server's last word about
a creature instead, which can be several tenths of a second old while that
creature is moving. That is the one thing about position a plugin can see
differ between sessions, and it follows from the content, not from the window.

### Answered in plain words rather than missing

Two of the client's own chat verbs draw something, and a client with nothing to
draw on says so instead of not knowing the verb:

```
/nav grid    -> Navigation: this client has nothing to draw the grid on
/nav route X -> Navigation: this client has nothing to draw a route on
```

Everything else `/nav` and `/motor` do is identical on both, because both are
registered once, by the shared binding pass, on the one command registry each
client hands plugins. A verb a plugin registers is reachable from a chat box
and from the headless console alike.

### Host services rather than automation

These are on `IPluginHost`, not on the automation surface, and they are the
places a windowless client genuinely has nothing behind the interface:

- `Ui` is the inert no-op registry. A gameplay panel registered through
  `IUiRegistry.AddMarkupPanel` loads without error and is never drawn.
- `Hotkeys` is the inert no-op registry -- there is no keyboard to bind to.
  `Register` returns a handle whose `IsBound` is `false`, and the handler never
  fires.
- `Clipboard` is the inert no-op clipboard.
- `Window.Minimize`, `Window.Restore` and `Window.IsMinimized` stay at the
  interface's inert defaults. `Window.RequestClose` is real: it ends this
  plugin's own session, not the whole process, the same way a bot policy ends
  its own session when it decides it is done. A second session hosted by the
  same process is untouched; only the console's `/quit` and a SIGINT/SIGTERM
  end every session at once.
- `Storage` and `VtankProfiles` are real, in the same on-disk layout the
  windowed client uses. They are process-wide rather than session-scoped, so
  two sessions in one process share one plugin settings file -- exactly as two
  plugin instances in one windowed process would.
- `LootClassifiers` is real, and a classifier published by one plugin can be
  asked for verdicts by another.
- `Log` writes into the headless diagnostic stream rather than to a window.

### The scenery list is empty

`State.SceneryObjects` is a fact about a drawn world: what the client placed,
and how far out, is decided by what it is drawing. A client that draws
nothing answers an empty list. `State.Entities`, `Events.EntitySpawned` and
the replay a late handler gets are the same on both clients -- one runtime
producer answers them, keyed on the same object directory -- so only the
scenery differs.

### One field a projection cannot fill

`Objects.TryGet` and `Objects.CaptureObjects` populate identically on both
clients -- name, weenie class id, item type, container and wielder ids,
classification, ownership, position, appraisal data, capacities, stack size,
door-open state, icon id. The exception is `ActiveSpellIds` for the local
player: the windowed client tracks a live active-enchantment list this one does
not, so it is empty here.

### Chat, and the console

`Chat` is real on both: `PostMessage`, `Submit`, `Compose`, `CaptureMessages`,
`Received`, `IsInputActive`, the suppression filters, the display filters
and the input interceptors all sit on the shared surface, and a line typed
at the console passes the interceptors the same way a line typed in a chat
box does. A display filter hides a line from the console the same way it
hides one from a chat window. `Compose` stages a line in the one chat entry
both front ends type into, so on a windowless client it appears at the
console and the next Enter sends it.

The headless console is that second front end, and `docs/building-and-running.md`
describes what can be typed at it.
